### Features implemented

 - I've tried to implement the app & main components while not focusing too much on styles and different properties because of time lack


### Challenges faced

- Was not sure why there was a border.color and backgroundColor.borderColor
- Getting the images
- I was not sure if https://embed.creatopy.com/?hash=j2308jq was build upon the same API data ( for example there is no scale on banner )



### If I had more time

- Add more features to the existing components such as buttons to have a hover state
- More attention to details to replicate it as best as possible with the one generated by your engine
- Rest of the bonus tasks
